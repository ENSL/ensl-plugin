ENSL Plugin
===========

This is the source code of ENSL Plugin. It was used on [European NS League](http://www.ensl.org) for many years.

Originally based on CAL Plugin, but later completely remade by Ari "jiriki" Timonen. Rest of the credits below:
	- DarkSnow's socket example
	- CAL Features by CAL-ns|Austin (xHomicide) and Jim "JazzX" Olson
	- Asmodee for waypoint fixes & weaponfix & other fixes
	- Multivac's Jetpack fix
	- sawce's icons plugin
	- www.nsmod.org
	- www.amxmodx.org

Right now only legacy code is the unstuck function from CAL Plugin. Full description of all the features is here:
